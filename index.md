For my project I created a project that calculates BMI based on user inputed height and weight.

The app also displays the weight-class for the calculated BMI.

There are  different classes of BMI.

They are: Very severely underweight, Severely underweight, Underweight, Normal (healthy weight), Overweight, Obese Class I (Moderately obese), Obese Class II (Severely obese), Obese Class III (Very severely obese).

Use the calculator to find out what you BMI is!
